# Iphone - E-commerce App

Iphone is an e-commerce app specifically developed for selling the iPhone 15 Pro. This app is a clone of the official Apple website for the iPhone 15 Pro and was created as a practice project to learn how to create animations using GSAP and incorporate a 3D model of the iPhone using ThreeJS and React Three Fiber (R3F).

## Technologies

### Frontend
- **React**: Used for building the user interface. React allows for efficient and flexible development of UI components.
- **Vite**: A faster and lighter build tool and development server that optimizes the creation of React applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the app. Tailwind CSS offers high flexibility and quick development time.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: Used for creating complex and high-performance animations on the website.
- **ThreeJS**: A JavaScript library used to create 3D graphics in the browser. In this project, ThreeJS is used to display a 3D model of the iPhone 15 Pro.

### Backend
- **Sentry**: A tool for error monitoring and performance checking, integrated into the app to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

## Features
- The main goal of the project was to practice creating animations with GSAP and incorporating a 3D model of the iPhone 15 Pro using ThreeJS.
- The project was created using a tutorial by JS Mastery: [JS Mastery Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRQbRAJ4-Fs&t=4066s)


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
